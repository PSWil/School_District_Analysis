# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Now that we have completed the School District Analysis, the school board suspect that there may have been some academic dishonesty from the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. With this in mind Maria has asked us to fix the data so that the potential 9th grade reading and math scores do not have a negative impact on the true averages for the district. To do this the school board has asked that I replace all the 9th grade reading and math scores while retaining all the other data associated intact.

## Results
With our School District Analysis modified to exclude the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School, we can see how if at all our results have changed.
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
