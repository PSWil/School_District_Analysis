# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Now that we have completed the School District Analysis, the school board suspect that there may have been some academic dishonesty from the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. With this in mind Maria has asked us to fix the data so that the potential 9th grade reading and math scores do not have a negative impact on the true averages for the district. To do this the school board has asked that I replace all the 9th grade reading and math scores while retaining all the other data associated intact.

## Results
With our School District Analysis modified to exclude the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School, we can see how if at all our results have changed.
- How is the district summary affected?
  - With the Thomas High School 9th grade reading and math scores removed from the data set there was a very small change in the averages downward.
  - The average math and reading score hardly changed: Math 79 to 78.9 and Reading 81.9 to 81.9.
  - The change was more pronounced in the Percent Passing in Math, Reading and the Overall Passing which all dropped one percentage point. Math 75 to 74, Reading 86 to 85, and Overall 65 to 64.
