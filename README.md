# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Now that we have completed the School District Analysis, the school board suspect that there may have been some academic dishonesty from the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. With this in mind Maria has asked us to fix the data so that the potential 9th grade reading and math scores do not have a negative impact on the true averages for the district. To do this the school board has asked that I replace all the 9th grade reading and math scores while retaining all the other data associated intact.

## Results
With our School District Analysis modified to exclude the 9th grade reading and math scores from Thomas High School, we can see how if at all our results have changed.
- How is the district summary affected?
  - With the Thomas High School 9th grade reading and math scores removed from the data set there was a very small change in the averages downward.
  - The average math and reading score hardly changed: Math 79 to 78.9 and Reading 81.9 to 81.9.
  - The change was more pronounced in the Percent Passing in Math, Reading and the Overall Passing which all dropped one percentage point. Math 75 to 74, Reading 86 to 85, and Overall 65 to 64.

- How is the school summary affected?
  - Thomas High School's summary took a large impact when we removed the 9th grades reading and math scores.
  - Before cleaning the data Thomas High School's overall passing percentage was 91%, after cleaning the data the passing percentage was only 65%.
  - While the average math and reading scores for Thomas did not changed substantially. 
  - The percent passing math dropped from 93.2 to 66.9, the percent passing reading dropped from 97 to 69.7, and the percent passing overall dropped from 90.6 to 65.1.
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  - Thomas High School ranking after removing the scores changed drastically with their district ranking droping from 2nd to 8th when we removed the 9th grade reading and math scores.
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade? When we set the 9th grade reading and math scores to NaN this was equivalent to converting the scores to 0. The totals for Thomas High School percentage passing reading and math drop substantially seeing as the 9th grade scores are equal to 0.
  - Scores by school spending? Thomas High School sits in the $630-644 spending bracket and when we remove the 9th grade scores the percentages drop again. The percent passing math dropped from 73 to 67, the percent passing reading dropped from 84 to 77, and the percent passing overall dropped from 63 to 56.
  - Scores by school size? With 1635 students, Thomas High School is classified as a medium school in the district (1000 - 2000 students). Removing the 9th grade reading and math scores impacts the medium school percent passing averages negatively as well. Percent passing math dropped from 94 to 88, the percent passing reading dropped from 97 to 93, and the percent passing overall for medium size schools dropped from 91 to 85.
  - Scores by school type? Thomas High School is classified as a Charter school acording to the district. When we remove the 9th grade scores the percent passing averages drop, but not by as much when considering school spending and school size. The percent passing math dropped from 94 to 90, the percent passing reading dropped from 97 to 93, and the percent passing overall dropped from 90 to 87.

## Summary (finish after dinner)
After removing the Thomas High School's 9th grade reading and math scores due to suspected academic dishonesty we could see many pronounced changes in the results of the school districts data but were able to limit the disruption and uncertainty that comes with altering the data. Out of the changes in data that we saw there were four that were most prominent.
1. While not as striking a figure to witness the district summary was effected visibly by the removal of a single schools 9th grade class reading and math scores was able to drop the percentage passing in math, reading and overall by a full percentage point.
2. As far as Thomas High School its self the score in math and reading percentage passed was quite drastic. Before cleaning the data Thomas High School's overall passing percentage was 91%, after cleaning the data the passing percentage was only 65%. This is a massive reduction of percentage of students passed, and while it cannot be established at this time that all scores will be invalidated, a fraction of this reduction will still be substantial when it comes to Thomas High School.
3. Inside of the score above we can see in further detail that Thomas High School scored exceptionally well in its individual reading and math scores with the 9th grade recieving exceptionally high marks. However the removal of this classes scores has a large impact on Thomas HS. The percent passing math dropped from 93.2 to 66.9, the percent passing reading dropped from 97 to 69.7.
4. Because of the need to remove the 9th grade reading and math scores Thomas High School's ranking the district took a heavy hit. Thomas High School ranking changed drastically with their district ranking droping from 2nd to 8th.
